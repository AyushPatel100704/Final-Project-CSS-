        <p class="para-line head-desc">
          Food banking in Canada is about much more than handing out food to those in need<br>
		  Throughout the national network, dedicated community leaders and volunteers strive every day to respond to the demand in their communities, offer nutritious and fresh food options, find creative ways to source new high-quality products, and go well beyond food supports to help their clients.

             Together with our national network, we are leading the charge when it comes to spearheading innovative programs that not only enable food banks to acquire and distribute a steady supply of food and essential items, but also help to identify the root causes of food bank use across the country.

            <p class="para-line">
             While food banks exist to offer vital assistance to individuals and families experiencing financial hardships, food isn’t the only thing they provide. Many also serve as vital community hubs where people can connect to services and supports they might not normally have access to.

            Poverty, along with a lack of access to logistics, proper infrastructure, and transportation has resulted in many Canadians living in northern and remote communities to experience disproportionate levels of food insecurity. We recognize the need is urgent and that the time for change is now.

             By partnering with farmers, manufacturers and retailers to safely recover and redistribute surplus food at every point of the supply chain, the network of over 4,750 affiliate food banks and food agencies supported by Food Banks Canada is reducing the environmental impact of food waste while helping millions of people escape food poverty.
