              While poverty in Canada is determined by a range of factors and contexts, it does not affect everyone equally. Rather, it is a phenomenon that is, at its core, produced and sustained by colonialism, racism, marginalization, sexism, heteronormativity, ableism, and many other types of exclusion.The key to addressing poverty in Canada lies in understanding that certain groups of people lack access to adequate food, housing, social services, and social and political participation. eneral trend, First Nations people, Métis, Black people and racial.

          As an organization that supports a network of associations spanning coast-to-coast-to-coast, Food Banks Canada recognizes that our work takes place on the traditional territories of Indigenous Peoples that have cared for this land that we now call Canada since time immemorial.
          We acknowledge that many of us are settlers and that these lands that we live, work, meet and travel on are either subject to First Nations self-government under modern treaty, unceded and un-surrendered territories, or traditional territories from which First Nations, Metis, and Inuit Peoples have been displaced.

             In 2002, Quebec developed Canada’s first poverty reduction strategy. Since then, some provinces, territories, and the federal government have followed suit with plans of their own. Along the way, some governments have made great strides in their poverty reduction journey, while others have lagged behind.
             Now, in 2023, as Canada is faced with a new set of poverty and food insecurity challenges, Food Banks Canada is introducing the country’s first comprehensive poverty report to capture the nuances of provincial, territorial, and federal perspectives in one place.
